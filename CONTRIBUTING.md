# Contributing

We love your input! We want to make contributing to this project as easy and transparent as possible, whether it's:

- Reporting a bug
- Discussing the current state of the code
- Submitting a fix
- Proposing new features
- Becoming a maintainer

## Development Process

We use GitHub to host code, to track issues and feature requests, as well as accept pull requests.

## Pull Requests

Pull requests are the best way to propose changes to the codebase. We actively welcome your pull requests:

1. Fork the repo and create your branch from `main`.
2. If you've added code that should be tested, add tests.
3. If you've changed APIs, update the documentation.
4. Ensure the test suite passes.
5. Make sure your code lints.
6. Issue that pull request!

## Development Setup

1. Clone your fork of the repository
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   composer install
   ```
3. Run tests to ensure everything works:
   ```bash
   composer test
   ```

## Testing

We use PHPUnit for testing. Please ensure all tests pass before submitting a PR:

```bash
# Run all tests
composer test

# Run tests with coverage
composer test-coverage

# Run specific test file
vendor/bin/phpunit tests/Unit/PwaServiceTest.php

# Run specific test method
vendor/bin/phpunit --filter testMethodName
```

### Writing Tests

- Write tests for all new functionality
- Follow existing test patterns and naming conventions
- Use descriptive test method names
- Include both positive and negative test cases
- Test edge cases and error conditions

### Test Structure

```php
/** @test */
public function it_does_something_specific()
{
    // Arrange
    $input = 'test data';
    
    // Act
    $result = $this->service->doSomething($input);
    
    // Assert
    $this->assertEquals('expected', $result);
}
```

## Code Style

We use Laravel Pint for code formatting:

```bash
# Format code
composer format

# Check code style
vendor/bin/pint --test
```

### Style Guidelines

- Follow PSR-12 coding standards
- Use meaningful variable and method names
- Add docblocks for public methods
- Keep methods focused and small
- Use type hints where possible

## Documentation

- Update README.md if you change functionality
- Add or update docblocks for new methods
- Update configuration documentation for new options
- Include examples in documentation
- Keep documentation clear and concise

## Commit Messages

Write clear, descriptive commit messages:

```
Add icon generation validation

- Validate source image exists before processing
- Check output directory permissions
- Add proper error messages for common issues
- Include tests for validation logic
```

### Commit Message Format

- Use present tense ("Add feature" not "Added feature")
- Use imperative mood ("Move cursor to..." not "Moves cursor to...")
- Limit first line to 72 characters or less
- Reference issues and pull requests when applicable

## Issue Reporting

We use GitHub issues to track public bugs. Report a bug by [opening a new issue](https://github.com/alareqi/filament-pwa/issues).

### Bug Reports

Great bug reports tend to have:

- A quick summary and/or background
- Steps to reproduce
  - Be specific!
  - Give sample code if you can
- What you expected would happen
- What actually happens
- Notes (possibly including why you think this might be happening, or stuff you tried that didn't work)

### Feature Requests

We welcome feature requests! Please:

- Explain the problem you're trying to solve
- Describe the solution you'd like
- Consider alternative solutions
- Provide examples or mockups if applicable

## Development Guidelines
